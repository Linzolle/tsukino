# Notice
Tsukino Mai has unfortunately been discontinued. It has become too much stress for me to work on maintaining something, thus I have put it aside. I will keep the source code in case I ever wish to return, but she will be gone for now.

## Tsukino Mai
Tsukino Mai is a bot for Discord using Rapptz's [discord.py](https://github.com/Rapptz/discord.py) Python library, and also a Leafeon.
Mai has very few practical uses, but is instead almost entirely for fun, save for a few utility functions.

### Why is this here?
Ah yes, why upload my bot's source code? Well I found it very useful while programming her to use other people's source code as a helpful reference. Thus, I want to share her code with the world so that anyone else who wants to use an example to help has Mai to look at.
